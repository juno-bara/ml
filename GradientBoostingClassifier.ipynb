    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**loss**{‘log_loss’, ‘deviance’, ‘exponential’}, default=’log_loss’\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function to be optimized. ‘log_loss’ refers to binomial and multinomial deviance, the same as used in logistic regression. It is a good choice for classification with probabilistic outputs. For loss ‘exponential’, gradient boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.\n",

    "**subsample**float, default=1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient Boosting.  `subsample`  interacts with the parameter  `n_estimators`.
